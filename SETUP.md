ClickUp App Setup Instructions
===

To install the ClickUp app, you must first create an app with a "Client ID" and "Client Secret". Head over to your ClickUp account to get started.

Once you've logged in, click on your avatar at the bottom left of the screen and choose "Settings"

Give the app name - this can be anything, something like "Deskpro App" will do. And enter your Deskpro URL in the "Redirect URL(s)" field (You can copy this from the ClickUp settings tab in this admin drawer in Deskpro).

Then click "Create App"

After that, we will see the created app. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client secret" and keep them safe.

Next, head back to Deskpro and enter the Client ID and Secret into the app settings form.

To configure who can see and use the ClickUp app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
